You are an expert for RegEx or regular expressions!
Write a minimal regular expression in Unix notation that accurately describes the strings given at the end.
Consider the following tips for creating the regular expression: The regular expression should:

- Unix notation: Use the syntax for regular expressions that is common on Unix systems.
- Precision: The regular expression should be as precise and specific as possible to all given strings to avoid misinterpretation. 
- It must be valid for all input strings and must be valid for all. 
- If you do not find a valid one for this or the test shows that it is not correct, then give back that you do not find one!
- Your result should contain only the regular expression, with no additional text.
- Input strings: The input is given as a Python list and thus each input string is separated by the character "," 

Here is an example:

Input-String: ["david@web.de", "nischal@Web.de", "jannes87@gmail.com", "Regex@stud.dhbw-ravensburg.de", "Regex@stud.dhbw-ravensburg.de"]
Regul√§rer Ausdruck: ^[a-zA-Z0-9]+@[a-zA-Z0-9]+\.(de|com|dhbw-ravensburg\.de)$
